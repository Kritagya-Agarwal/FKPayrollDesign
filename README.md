### Problem Statement

Design a Software which serves a purpose of PayRoll System for a Company. Given notes are collected from the customer regarding details about use cases for software.

● Some employees work by the hour. They are paid an hourly rate that is one of the
fields in their employee record. They submit daily time cards that record the date
and the number of hours worked. If they work more than 8 hours per day, they
are paid 1.5 times their normal rate for those extra hours. They are paid every
Friday. 

● Some employees are paid a flat salary. They are paid on the last working day of
the month. Their monthly salary is one of the fields in their employee record.

● Some of the salaried employees are also paid a commission based on their sales.
They submit sales receipts that record the date and the amount of the sale. Their
commission rate is a field in their employee record. They are paid every other
Friday.

● Employees can select their method of payment. They may have their paychecks
mailed to the postal address of their choice; they may have their paychecks held
for pickup by the paymaster; or they can request that their paychecks be directly
deposited into the bank account of their choice.

● Some employees belong to the employee union. Their employee record has a field
for the weekly dues rate for union. Their dues must be deducted from their pay.
Also, the union may assess service charges e.g. membership fee, festival fees etc.against individual union members from time to time. These service charges are
submitted by the union on a weekly basis and must be deducted from the
appropriate employee’s next pay amount.

●
The payroll application will run once each working day and pay the appropriate
employees on that day. The system will be told to what date the employees are to
be paid, so it will generate payments for records from the last time the employee
was paid up to the specified date.

### Following Use Cases must be Implemented
1. Add a new employee
2. Delete an employee
3. Post a time card
4. Post a sales receipt
5. Post a union membership, service charge etc.
6. Change employee details (e.g., hourly rate, dues rate, membership fee etc)
7. Run the payroll for today
